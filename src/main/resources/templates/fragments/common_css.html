<!-- This is just a fragment so it won't have the boilerplate code -->

<!-- th:block tag will not return any html element, it is just a placeholder, so just like a logical block, when it is attached in home.html, or in any other
     html page, it will get th from the xmlns:th there. th:fragment is required to make a fragment. to give a name to the fragment, we put equal sign(=) after
     th:fragment and we write name inside "", so like th:fragment:"commonCss" -->
     
<th:block th:fragment="commonCss"> <!-- Right now it can't recognize th so it gives warning but when it is added to an html page, it will get th there -->
